					SMART on FHIR Examples: 002-authenticate
					<br/>
					A Simple Application to Show an Application in an EMR
					<br/>
					and Authenticate to the EMR
				</h1>
			</div>

			<!-- introduction -->
			<p>
				This section will demonstrate how to add the simplest of SMART on FHIR applications to an EMR.  
				This is not really a common use case of a complete application  
				but it does provide us with a simplest case we can use to confirm that basic functionality, 
				including authentication, is working properly.  
			</p>

				<!-- clone and checkout -->
				<h2>Step 01: Clone and Checkout the smart-on-fhir-examples application <nobr>v1.0.0-002-authenticate</nobr></h2>
				The smart-on-fhir-examples application v1.0.0-002-authenticate branch can be cloned 
				and checked out using git by running the following commands.  
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
git clone https://github.com/NACHC-CAD/smart-on-fhir-examples
cd smart-on-fhir-examples
git checkout v1.0.0-002-authenticate
</pre>
				<img width="800px" src="./img/clone-and-checkout.JPG" />
				<br/><br/>

				<!-- add to tomcat -->
				<h2>Step 02: Add the Application to Tomcat</h2>
				Use the Eclipse tools to add the application to Tomcat.  
				<br/>
				<img width="800px" src="./img/tomcat.JPG" />
				<br/><br/>

				<!-- confirm 001 -->
				<h2>Step 03: Confirm the Application Has Been Deployed Successfully</h2>
				Confirm that the application has been deployed successfully by opening a browser and entering the following url:
				<br/>
				<pre class="pre-scrollable">http://localhost:8080/smart-on-fhir-examples/index.html</pre>				
				<img width="800px" src="./img/confirm-001.JPG" />
				<br/><br/>
				
				Then click on the link to confirm that the launch page has been successfully deployed.  
				<br/>
				<pre class="pre-scrollable">http://localhost:8080/smart-on-fhir-examples/002-authenticate/launch.html</pre>				
				<img width="800px" src="./img/confirm-002.JPG" />
				<br/><br/>
				
				<!-- launch -->
				<h2>Step 04: Launch the Application in the SmartHealthIt Test Application</h2>
				The behavior of our application in an EMR can be tested 
				by navigating to the SmartHealthIt test application 
				and entering the URL of our application into the launch window. 
				<br/>
				Navigate to the SmartHealthIt test application at the URL below. 
				<pre class="pre-scrollable">https://launch.smarthealthit.org/</pre>
				Enter the URL of our application in the launch window.
				<pre class="pre-scrollable">http://localhost:8080/smart-on-fhir-examples/002-authenticate/launch.html</pre>
				<img class="bordered" width="800px" src="./img/launch-001.JPG" />
				<br/>
				<br/><br/>
				
				<!-- success -->
				<h2>Step 05: Success!</h2>
				When the Launch button is selected, you should see the sequence of screens shown below.  
				<img class="bordered" width="800px" src="./img/launch-002.JPG" />
				<img class="bordered" width="800px" src="./img/launch-003.JPG" />
				<img class="bordered" width="800px" src="./img/launch-004.JPG" />
